# WatchTheSystem
A client server python based monitoring system just for playing and showing my kids.

## Server
Running on RPi with rainbow HAT.

## Client
Running in Win10.

## How it works
Client sends UDP packet to the server to port 12345. Client uses GuiZero to make it look pretty. Server uses Rainow HAT module.
